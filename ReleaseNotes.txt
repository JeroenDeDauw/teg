			          v0.12                                       


ChangeLog:
 . Fixed a remote DoS in the client: The server could crash the client with invalid
   highscore data.
   
 . Feature Request 539564 implemented (Moving Armies). Now, by default all armies
   are moved during regrouping which makes regrouping a lot easier. Remember: If you
   do not want to move any armies simply press ESC to close the window. If you want
   to move all armies, press ENTER to accept the default value. This way you can
   regroup with a minimum of clicks.
   
 . Included a patch by Patrik Nilsson that allows to hide robot messages but still see
   messages from human players. For those of you who are tired of the witty comment
   the robots make ;)
 
 . Included patch from Gonï¿½ri Le Bouder to convert documentation to XML to make yelp
   (Gnome help browser) happy. Will have to think of something for people without
   Gnome
   
 . Bug 490577 was solved (game too slow if only computer is left). After finishing
   the present round at normal speed, the robots play at more than 3 times the normal
   speed. This way it you don't have to watch the robots play for minutes when you
   have lost.
 
 . Bug 1634396 was solved (Teg deals two identical country cards & then refuses to exch).
   When exchanging 3 cards, only 2 were marked as unused which confused the program
   once all cards were marked as used.
   
 . Bug 1634392 was solved ([crash]tegclient can't start with an invalid theme setting).
   Teg now tries to load themes "m2" or "sentimental" if the configured theme cannot
   be loaded.
   
 . Bug 689687 was solved (Error, unexpected error in reagrupe_click()).
 
 . Bug 573300 was solved (error in ataque_click()).
 
 . Bug 553375 marked as solved (select(): invalid file descriptor). This one was
   probably already fixed in 0.11.2 since a buffer overflow in the tegrobot was fixed.
   If anyone still sees this bug, please report it!
   
Known Bugs:
 . Hiscore list and game result list handle color names incorrectly.
 . Some server ouput not I18nized at all.
 . Teg gets confused if you press ESC in the color selection dialog.
