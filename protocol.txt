TypeofGame [MODIFIED]:
==========
Description:
	TypeOfGame, also known is spanish as 'modalidad', was used previously
	to tell the players, after sending the 'start' message, to tell the
	rules of the game (actually not used), and if the server was set to
	play with secret missions.
	Now, it also sends 2 more variables: Fog of War, and Common mission.
	Fog of war: set to true if Fog of war is activated
	Common mission: set to true, if playing with common secret mission
	 of conquering 30 countries.
	Also, now the client can request the TypeOfGame. Before, only the server
	was sending this message after starting the game.
