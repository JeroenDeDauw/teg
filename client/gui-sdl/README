The content in this directory is the early alpha version of the SDL C client.
It is far from been finnished and it contains right now just some test on the
different features that needs to be implemented on the client.

If you want to compile the code and make the library for the client run:

source compile
source library

This will create libguiclient.a that must be used to compile the tegclient.

At this moment, the library have this features:

* the board is created and displayed
* if you place the mouse pointer over some country, the name of it is
  displayed on the standard output

These are the packages required to compile the library, between parenthesis
are the package name in Debian (I'm developing the client under Debian).

* SDL (libsdl1.2debian)
* SDL_image (libsdl-image1.2)
