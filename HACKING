Hi,
  So you want to help the developent of TEG ? cool!

  1. Please, consider joining the teg-list.
     Also, try to join the teg-changes, where you will see
     the changes in the CVS

  2. I'm using tab spaces of 8. If you are using vi:
  	set ts=8 sw=8

  3. If your function will return a value, consider returning a TEG_STATUS
     type.

  4. Try to uses K&R coding style


How to send patches:

  1. Send them to the list or to the patch manager.

  2. For single files:
  	diff -u
     For recursive patches:
     	diff -u -r
     For new files
     	diff -u -r -N

riq.
